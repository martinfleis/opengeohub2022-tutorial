    "\n",
    "GeoPandas, as the name suggests, extends the popular data science library [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org) by adding support for geospatial data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The core data structure in GeoPandas is the `geopandas.GeoDataFrame`, a subclass of `pandas.DataFrame`, that can store geometry columns and perform spatial operations. The `geopandas.GeoSeries`, a subclass of `pandas.Series`, handles the geometries. Therefore, your `GeoDataFrame` is a combination of `pandas.Series`, with traditional data (numerical, boolean, text etc.), and `geopandas.GeoSeries`, with geometries (points, polygons etc.). You can have as many columns with geometries as you wish; there's no limit typical for desktop GIS software.\n",
    "\n",
    "![geodataframe schema](fig/dataframe.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Each `GeoSeries` can contain any geometry type (you can even mix them within a single array) and has a `GeoSeries.crs` attribute, which stores information about the projection (CRS stands for Coordinate Reference System). Therefore, each `GeoSeries` in a `GeoDataFrame` can be in a different projection, allowing you to have, for example, multiple versions (different projections) of the same geometry.\n",
    "\n",
    "Only one `GeoSeries` in a `GeoDataFrame` is considered the _active_ geometry, which means that all geometric operations applied to a `GeoDataFrame` operate on this _active_ column.\n",
    "\n",
    "But when we talk about GeoPandas, we first have to talk about pandas."

    "- *data*\n",
    "    - We just learned that this part is covered by `pandas`.\n",
    "- *geometry*\n",
    "    - Handling of the actual geometries and operations on them. In FOSS, there is one leading engine, `GEOS`, but given it is written in C++, we need a Python wrapper. That is called `shapely`.\n",
    "- *projections*\n",
    "    - We need to know which place on the Earth (or other planet) each coordinates refer to. That is what projections, or Coordinate Reference Systems (CRS), take care of. The main FOSS engine here is `PROJ`, again written in C++ and in Python wrapped by `pyproj`.\n",
    "- *reading and writing files*\n",
    "    - Geospatial world knows a lot of file formats to store the data, from Shapefile and GeoJSON to GeoParquet. The best way to read and write into them is to use `GDAL/OGR`, another C++ library, which is avaliable either via `fiona` or recently via `pyogrio`.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Reading files\n",

    "Assuming you have a file containing both data and geometry (e.g. GeoPackage, GeoJSON, Shapefile), you can read it using `geopandas.read_file()`, which automatically detects the filetype and creates a `GeoDataFrame`. This can use either `fiona` or `pyogrio` as an engine (as of GeoPandas 0.11) interfacing GDAL/OGR to do the heavy lifting. We use `pyogrio` as a newer, faster option.\n",
    "\n",
